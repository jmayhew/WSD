		<h2>Exercise Your Brain</h2>
			<p>Math Club offers animated, dynamic, and interactive games. The games include fractions, dividing, multiplication, adding, and subtracting. The speed at which students can formulate counts. This makes it more challenging-and fun also! These games will not only increase a student's focus level throughout the day, but, eliminate fears of not being 
			good at the subject of math.</p>

 				<h3>Parental Review</h3>
 					<p>Published 08/06/13</p>
 			
 						<p>My daughter signed up for Math Club in October. After two weeks of interactive gaming she stopped asking for help with her homework. Adelyn's grades went up after a month. Thank you Math Club!</p>
